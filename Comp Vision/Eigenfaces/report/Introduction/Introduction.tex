\chapter{Introduction}
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was independently proposed by Karl Pearson
(1901) and Harold Hotelling (1933) to turn a set of possibly correlated variables
into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables. The idea is, that a high-dimensional
dataset is often described by correlated variables and therefore only a few
meaningful dimensions account for most of the information. The PCA method finds
the directions with the greatest variance in the data, called principal components.

This project is to implement PCA by Python.
